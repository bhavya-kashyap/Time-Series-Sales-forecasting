# Time-Series-Sales-forecasting
####The focus of the project is to help businesses to optimize store inventory management and supply chain planning by predicting demand for products that customers are expected to buy in the future in a specific duration, which would help anticipate consumer demand and prepare for any changes in consumer behavior. The project aims to forecast sales of items which could be leveraged to forecast future sales and help businesses optimize their inventory based on the predicted sales. This could further help businesses in preparing data driven and informed marketing strategies. Furthermore, it would help organizations in observing and analyzing trends, account for market conditions like inflation, competitors and make financial decisions accordingly.
